AI-XBS + Transparency Fund System (Blockchain-Based)
📌 Overview

This project is a Unified Anti-Corruption Platform that combines:

💰 Transparency Fund System
🔍 AI-XBS (AI-driven X-ray & Blockchain System)

Both systems work independently but are integrated into a single web application to ensure transparency, accountability, and security in governance and inspection processes.

🧠 Core Idea

The platform eliminates corruption by:

Tracking public funds transparently
Detecting illegal or suspicious items using AI
Recording all activities in tamper-proof blockchain ledgers
